# Codecademy Project: Website Design System

## Overview

Welcome to the Website Design System project, created as part of the Codecademy curriculum. 
This project focuses on building a design system. I chose to include multiple color palettes and font combinations. 
The design system aims to provide a cohesive and consistent visual identity for web projects.

## Features

- **Color Palettes:** Explore a variety of carefully curated color palettes to enhance the visual appeal of your websites.
  Each palette is designed to promote a harmonious and professional look.

- **Font Combinations:** Choose from a selection of font combinations that strike the right balance between readability and aesthetics.
  The provided font pairings are versatile and can be used across different types of content.
